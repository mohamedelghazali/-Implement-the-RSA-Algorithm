# -Implement-the-RSA-Algorithm (CPP)

This C++ program encodes any message using RSA Algorithm. Input is case sensitive and works only for all characters. RSA is one of the first practicable public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission. In such a cryptosystem, the encryption key is public and differs from the decryption key which is kept secret. In RSA, this asymmetry is based on the practical difficulty of factoring the product of two large prime numbers, the factoring problem .

The C++ program is successfully compiled and run on a Linux system. The program output is also shown below.
